# Fish key

My friend [Agata](http://aand.dkonto.pl/chmur/) had a good idea of creating a key for [12-tone equal music notation](http://musicnotation.org/systems/group/whole-step-5-lines/). It's called Fish key and it shows where F sharp (Fis in German naming) note is laying. Enjoy!

I wrote about alternative music notation in a [past post](/blog/equal-music/).
