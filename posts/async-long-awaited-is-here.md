# Async await has come to Node.js

I just discovered that `async` `await` has been implemented in Nodejs v7.1.0.

I'm very excited about it. Be excited with me!

The new syntax changes the way we think about asynchronous javascript forever.
No more callback hell. No more <span title="or at least not much">chaining of `.then()`</span>. Just `async`, `await` and a little bit of `Promise`s.
