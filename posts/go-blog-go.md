# Go blog, go!

The blog is now powered by a minimal system based on [go](http://golang.org) + markdown + json. You can <span title="and reuse if you're insane">see</span> the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrkvon/blogo). Spoiler: It's rather messy, still.

This is a dawn of a new era. There might appear more posts here in the near future. Freedom, collaboration, coding, music, homeful living.
