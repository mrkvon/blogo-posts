There is a bad insult in Czech republic.
Widely used by parents, teachers and peers to make you feel ashamed.

"Jsi normální?" "Are you normal?"

Come to a random classroom, family, playground, ... And you'll hear it. I've certainly used it myself many times. Without even being aware of the meaning.

As if normality is a virtue. As if conformity, meeting the expectations, being average is something worth striving for.

As if diversity, multitude of opinions, cultures and peoples can harm us.

May it be why xenofobia, fear of the unfamiliar and rasism is so deeply rooted in the Czech culture? May it be one of the causes or symptoms?

Are you from Czech? Have you noticed?

Are you from other country? Does your culture have something similar?

# Are you normal?
