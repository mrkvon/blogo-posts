# Speak that language

I started a new method of learning a new language: Download a book and read it loud for the <span title="certainly you need to know when the night comes for the servers">bedtime</span> of [google translator](https://translate.google.com). I don't know how much one can learn like this, but it's fun and engaging. You need to know the alphabet first though.

Get inspired by a talk [How to learn any language in 6 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0) (18min).

Learn the most common words of the language. Here is a nice [word list to download](https://fluent-forever.com/thank-free-word-list-download/) and a [related theory](https://fluent-forever.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/).

So much about my todays' discoveries. Speak that language. Have fun.
