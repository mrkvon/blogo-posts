# Just quit the facebook!

You've wasted way too much life on it, haven't you? How much time do you spend on facebook every week? What could you do instead?

They distract you and manipulate you. They drink your life like a wampire drinks blood. They live off your attention.

They know everything about you.

_Quit! Now! Please!_
