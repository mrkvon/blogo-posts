# Short on Self-ownership

[Self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership) comes also with responsibility: We are responsible for our feelings. Nobody else is.

It's a new discovery for me.

Self-ownership always meant to me the right to enter only the relations/contracts one chooses to. It leads to greater freedom. The self-ownership of the feelings gives a sense of greater _inner_ freedom to me.

You didn't make me feel any way. It's my feeling. It's up to me to work with it. I can never blame you. I own myself. I'm free.
